                <p><strong>Topic:</strong> The Reality of a Lean Engineer’s Role<br><strong>The Trap:</strong> Thinking your job is just “fixing things.”</p><p>If you ask a professor what a Lean Engineer does, they’ll say: “Continuous Improvement.”<br>If you ask me, I’ll tell you the job is actually two distinct battles:</p><ol>
<li><strong>The Attack:</strong> Continuously Eliminating Waste.</li>
<li><strong>The Defense:</strong> Sustaining the Gains.</li>
</ol>
<p>Most new grads crush the first part and fail the second. Here is why.</p><hr>
<h3 id="phase-1-the-maverick-the-attack">Phase 1: The Maverick (The Attack)</h3>
<p>This is the fun part. You are the detective.</p><p>You walk onto the floor, clipboard in hand, looking for Shingo’s <strong>7 Wastes</strong> (Defects, Overproduction, Waiting, etc.) plus the deadliest one: <strong>The Waste of Human Talent/Ideas.</strong></p><p>In this phase, you can be a <strong>Maverick</strong>. You can run the data, identify the bottleneck, and design a fix all by yourself. You are the hero with the spreadsheet.</p><p><strong>The result:</strong> You save the company money. You feel like a genius.</p><hr>
<h3 id="phase-2-the-politician-the-defense">Phase 2: The Politician (The Defense)</h3>
<p>This is where the “Introvert Tax” hits hard.</p><p>You improved the process. Great. Now, how do you make sure the operators don’t go back to the old way the second you leave the room?</p><p><strong>The “Paper Shield” is Weak</strong><br>In school, they teach you to update the documentation:</p><ul>
<li>Control Plans</li>
<li>Standard Operating Procedures (SOPs)</li>
<li>Publishing via the PLM (Product Lifecycle Management) system</li>
</ul>
<p><strong>The Reality:</strong> Documents are passive. They live on servers. To sustain change, you need <strong>Active Enforcement</strong>:</p><ol>
<li><strong>Visual Management:</strong> Don’t just write a rule; put tape on the floor or a shadow board on the wall. Make it impossible to ignore.</li>
<li><strong>LPA (Layered Process Audits):</strong> If management doesn’t check it, operators won’t do it.</li>
<li><strong>Gemba Walks:</strong> You need to be seen on the floor, verifying the fix.</li>
</ol>
<p>But even with these tools, you need <strong>Influence</strong>.</p><hr>
<h3 id="the-owner-mindset">The “Owner” Mindset</h3>
<p>To survive Phase 2, you need to drop the “I’m just a new grad” attitude.</p><p>You need to walk into the Kaizen project with absolute, unwavering confidence. You need the attitude of:</p><blockquote>
<p>“I am the Subject Matter Expert. Nobody knows this data better than
me.”</p></blockquote>
<p>It sounds arrogant? Good.<br>If you are leading a change, you are the <strong>de facto leader</strong> in that room.</p><ul>
<li><strong>Don’t</strong> sit in the back corner of the meeting.</li>
<li><strong>Don’t</strong> be afraid of the Production Manager.</li>
<li><strong>Do</strong> speak first. Frame the problem. Own the solution.</li>
<li><strong>Do</strong> actively seek helps from your own department.</li>
</ul>
<h3 id="how-to-win-the-turf-war">How to Win the “Turf War”</h3>
<p>You cannot order people from other departments to listen to you. You have no authority over them.</p><p>You have to use <strong>“The Borrowed Sword.”</strong></p><ol>
<li><strong>Find the Department Head:</strong> The person who actually owns the staff you are trying to change.</li>
<li><strong>Sell the Benefit (WIIFM):</strong> Don’t tell them “It’s Lean.” Tell them, “This change will save your team 20 hours of overtime a month.”</li>
<li><strong>Get the Endorsement:</strong> Once the Department Head sees the benefit, ask them to announce it.</li>
</ol>
<p>When the boss says, “We are doing this,” the team follows. You are just the architect; let the Department Head be the enforcer.</p><h3 id="the-takeaway">The Takeaway</h3>
<p><strong>Phase 1 (Fixing)</strong> requires IQ.<br><strong>Phase 2 (Sustaining)</strong> requires EQ (Emotional Intelligence) and Guts.</p><p>Don’t just be a smart engineer. Be a loud one.</p>

                <p><strong>Topic</strong>: Handling Customer Complaints
<strong>The Academic View</strong>: “The Voice of the Customer is sacred. Whatever they ask for, do it.”
<strong>The Reality</strong>: The customer’s “wants” are a bottomless pit that will bankrupt you.</p><h3 id="the-golden-rule">The Golden Rule</h3>
<p>In Cantonese, there is a saying that perfectly describes the life of a Quality Engineer:</p><div style="text-align: center;"> <img loading="lazy" src="大事化小，小事化無.jpg" alt="大事化小，小事化無" width="400" data-is-external-image="true"> </div>

<p>Translation: “Make big problems small, and make small problems disappear.”</p><p>This is the art of <span style="color: #920D14;"><em><strong>De-escalation</strong></em></span>.</p><h3 id="the-trap-the-perfect-solution">The Trap: “The Perfect Solution”</h3>
<p>When a defect happens, the customer (usually an SQE - Supplier Quality Engineer) naturally panics. They demand the moon: 100% third-party sorting, brand new tooling, air freight, and a 50-page report.</p><p>If you say “Yes” to everything, you fail.</p><ul>
<li><strong>The Cost</strong>: Your company eats the bill for sorting and rework.</li>
<li><strong>The Precedent</strong>: You teach the customer that they can bully you every time.</li>
</ul>
<h3 id="the-psychology-of-your-counterpart">The Psychology of Your Counterpart</h3>
<p>To win, you have to understand who you are talking to. The SQE on the other side isn’t evil. They are just having a really bad day:</p><ol>
<li><strong>Their Production Team</strong> is yelling at them because the line stopped.</li>
<li><strong>Their Boss</strong> is asking for a report.</li>
<li><strong>They are scared</strong> they can’t handle it.</li>
</ol>
<p>Key Insight: If they feel like they can’t handle the issue, they will <em><strong>Escalate</strong></em>.
Escalation = Management gets involved = Trust goes down = Future business is lost.</p><p>Your job isn’t just to fix the part. It is to <strong>make the SQE feel safe</strong> so they don’t hit the panic button.</p><h3 id="the-playbook-how-to-de-escalate">The Playbook: How to De-escalate</h3>
<p> <strong>Internal Rule #1:</strong>
<strong>Never lie to yourself.</strong> Internally, you must find the true Root Cause, fix the process, and update the control plan. If you don’t fix it, the problem comes back, and you die.</p><p><strong>External Rule #2:</strong><br><strong>Filter the noise.</strong> Once the internal fix is solid, your communication strategy changes based on the severity.</p><p><span style="font-size: 0.8em;"><strong>Scenario A: The “Small” Thing (Low Risk/Low FMEA score)</strong></span></p><ul>
<li>The Situation: A minor cosmetic defect or a one-off glitch.</li>
<li>The Goal: Make it disappear (“let it go”).</li>
<li>The Move: Leverage your relationship. Show them the data.</li>
</ul>
<blockquote>
<p>“Hey, looking at the FMEA, the risk is negligible. We’ve already
implemented [Fix X] internally so it won’t happen again. Let’s treat
this as an isolated incident. No need for third-party sorting.”</p></blockquote>
<p><span style="font-size: 0.8em;"><strong>Scenario A: The “Small” Thing (Low Risk/Low FMEA score)</strong></span></p><ul>
<li>The Situation: It’s bad.</li>
<li>The Goal: Make it small.</li>
<li>The Move: Provide an “Easy Button.”<ul>
<li>Don’t let them panic about air freight or line-down.</li>
<li>Give them a containment plan immediately that makes them look good to their boss.</li>
</ul>
</li>
</ul>
<blockquote>
<p>“We have a containment team ready. Here is the immediate clean point.
You don’t need to stop the line; we have you covered.”</p></blockquote>
<h3 id="lean-corner-why-this-is-technical-not-just-political">Lean Corner: Why this is Technical, not just Political</h3>
<p>You might think, “Tim, isn’t this just playing politics?”<br>No. This is <strong>Lean Manufacturing</strong>.</p><p>One of the deadly wastes in Lean is <strong>Over-processing</strong> (doing more work than the customer actually needs).</p><ul>
<li><strong>Reactive Engineering:</strong> The customer yells -&gt; You panic -&gt; You spend $10k on air freight for a $50 issue. <strong>(Waste)</strong></li>
<li><strong>Lean Engineering:</strong> You analyze the risk -&gt; You prove the process is safe -&gt; You ship standard ground. <strong>(Value)</strong></li>
</ul>
<p>De-escalation isn’t about hiding problems. It’s about Confidence. <strong>Don’t let panic create waste.</strong>
<strong>Fix the part. Manage the panic. Save the money.</strong></p>
