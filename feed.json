They demand the moon: 100% third-party sorting, brand new tooling, air freight, and a 50-page report.</p><p>If you say “Yes” to everything, you fail.</p><ul>\n<li><strong>The Cost</strong>: Your company eats the bill for sorting and rework.</li>\n<li><strong>The Precedent</strong>: You teach the customer that they can bully you every time.</li>\n</ul>\n<h3 id=\"the-psychology-of-your-counterpart\">The Psychology of Your Counterpart</h3>\n<p>To win, you have to understand who you are talking to. The SQE on the other side isn’t evil. They are just having a really bad day:</p><ol>\n<li><strong>Their Production Team</strong> is yelling at them because the line stopped.</li>\n<li><strong>Their Boss</strong> is asking for a report.</li>\n<li><strong>They are scared</strong> they can’t handle it.</li>\n</ol>\n<p>Key Insight: If they feel like they can’t handle the issue, they will <em><strong>Escalate</strong></em>.\nEscalation = Management gets involved = Trust goes down = Future business is lost.</p><p>Your job isn’t just to fix the part. It is to <strong>make the SQE feel safe</strong> so they don’t hit the panic button.</p><h3 id=\"the-playbook-how-to-de-escalate\">The Playbook: How to De-escalate</h3>\n<p> <strong>Internal Rule #1:</strong>\n<strong>Never lie to yourself.</strong> Internally, you must find the true Root Cause, fix the process, and update the control plan. If you don’t fix it, the problem comes back, and you die.</p><p><strong>External Rule #2:</strong><br><strong>Filter the noise.</strong> Once the internal fix is solid, your communication strategy changes based on the severity.</p><p><span style=\"font-size: 0.8em;\"><strong>Scenario A: The “Small” Thing (Low Risk/Low FMEA score)</strong></span></p><ul>\n<li>The Situation: A minor cosmetic defect or a one-off glitch.</li>\n<li>The Goal: Make it disappear (“let it go”).</li>\n<li>The Move: Leverage your relationship. Show them the data.</li>\n</ul>\n<blockquote>\n<p>“Hey, looking at the FMEA, the risk is negligible. We’ve already\nimplemented [Fix X] internally so it won’t happen again. Let’s treat\nthis as an isolated incident. No need for third-party sorting.”</p></blockquote>\n<p><span style=\"font-size: 0.8em;\"><strong>Scenario A: The “Small” Thing (Low Risk/Low FMEA score)</strong></span></p><ul>\n<li>The Situation: It’s bad.</li>\n<li>The Goal: Make it small.</li>\n<li>The Move: Provide an “Easy Button.”<ul>\n<li>Don’t let them panic about air freight or line-down.</li>\n<li>Give them a containment plan immediately that makes them look good to their boss.<blockquote>\n<p>“We have a containment team ready. Here is the immediate clean point.\nYou don’t need to stop the line; we have you covered.”</p></blockquote>\n</li>\n</ul>\n</li>\n</ul>\n<h3 id=\"lean-corner-why-this-is-technical-not-just-political\">Lean Corner: Why this is Technical, not just Political</h3>\n<p>You might think, “Tim, isn’t this just playing politics?”<br>No. This is <strong>Lean Manufacturing</strong>.</p><p>One of the deadly wastes in Lean is <strong>Over-processing</strong> (doing more work than the customer actually needs).</p><ul>\n<li><strong>Reactive Engineering:</strong> The customer yells -&gt; You panic -&gt; You spend $10k on air freight for a $50 issue. <strong>(Waste)</strong></li>\n<li><strong>Lean Engineering:</strong> You analyze the risk -&gt; You prove the process is safe -&gt; You ship standard ground. <strong>(Value)</strong></li>\n</ul>\n<p>De-escalation isn’t about hiding problems. It’s about Confidence. <strong>Don’t let panic create waste.</strong>\n<strong>Fix the part. Manage the panic. Save the money.</strong></p>",
