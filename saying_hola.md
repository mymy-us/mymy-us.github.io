## *Saying ¡Hola!*
##### [Who I Am]
My name is Tim, a young adult who focused on lean manufacturing back in college. I've walked the talk, starting as an intern lean engineer in a doll company and now working as a design quality engineer in the automotive industry.

I do gym, so I ain't a skinny biatch. I'm also currently learning Spanish, so please feel free to ***say ¡hola!*** to me.

##### [Why I Post]
The transition from college to a workplace can be painful for new grads. 

The knowledge from school often doesn't connect, or it was never taught in the first place. To make it worse, sometimes a mentor hides key insights to protect their own competency. Other times, you don't even have an active mentor/supervisor, and your coworkers are either too busy for you or simply don't want to mind you at all.

I've been through that pain. I'm here to share my experiences so you don't have to.

My belief: *There is nothing to hide. We can see further because we are standing on the shoulders of giants.*

##### [What We Can Get]
Here, I will:
-   Share my knowledge and thoughts on bridging the gap between academy and industry
-   Keep concise — **no bullshit edition**
-   Welcome a genuine exchange of ideas.

Nk, now, let's go my, my! us.
